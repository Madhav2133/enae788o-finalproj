# ENAE788O - Final Project

## Bio-Inspired Swarm Flocking with Minimal Communication for Adaptive Search Operations

## Introduction:

This project aims to develop and simulate an autonomous surface swarm system with bio-inspired flocking for search tasks, with adaptive formation control in a simulated ocean environment using a decentralized control system to enable minimal communication while maintaining coordination.
