# ENAE788O - Final Project

## Bio-Inspired Swarm Flocking with Minimal Communication for Adaptive Search Operations

## Introduction:

This project aims to develop and simulate an autonomous surface swarm system with bio-inspired flocking for search tasks, with adaptive formation control in a simulated ocean environment using a decentralized control system to enable minimal communication while maintaining coordination.

## Code Base:

This repository currently consists of four main codes:

### csa.py

This script is an implementation of the standard CSA Flocking Algorithm.

### modified_csa.py

This script is an implementation of the Modified CSA Flocking Algorithm by introducing the Information Bias.

### sar_modified_csa.py

This script is an implementation of the Search and Rescue Mission (SAR) on top of using the Modified CSA Flocking Algorithm by introducing the Information Bias.

### fsm.py

This script introduces FSM to the Search and Rescue Mission (SAR) on top of using the Modified CSA Flocking Algorithm.
